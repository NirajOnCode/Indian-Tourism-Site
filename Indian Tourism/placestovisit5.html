								<h3>Dwarka</h3>
								<p><strong>Dwarka</strong>The land of Shri Krishna’s empire, Dwarka was once an island. During the time of Lord Shri Krishna, some 5000 years ago, its is believed that he fled Mathura with his people, and made this inhabitable land home. In the middle of the Arabian Sea, Lord Krishna settled a beautiful city, that many believe was made of gold. Then when he left this earth, by some stroke of misfortune, his children and clansmen, in drunken rage, fought and drowned all that was worthy. Today, Dwarka is a city that worships Lord Krishna as Dwarkadhish — the king of Dwarka. And underwater excavations do recover artefacts, pots, pillars and such that really are made of gold. With its temples, rocky coastal lines, beaches and markets, Dwarka is a beautiful tourist spot in North Gujarat.</p>
