								<h3>Panaji</h3>
								<p><strong>Panaji</strong> (aka Panjim) is the capital city of Goa. A melting pot of cultures from around India and the world, you won't find any shortage of entertainment in this city. The Fontainhas Festival brings Panjim to life at the start of every New Year. Musicians, singers, artists and dancers from all over the country gather in Panjim to participate.

								<h3>Old-goa</h3>
								<p><strong>Old-goa</strong>Old Goa Few tourists look beyond Goa's sun kissed beaches, but with some good planning and a resourceful tour manager, you will be able to discover a side of the 'sun-kissed state' that you wouldn't see otherwise. Visit Old Goa if you're in the mood to go back in time and wander through quaint Christian and Portuguese villages nestled among lush paddy fields and magnificent cathedrals and churches bursting at the seams with history.</p>

								<p><strong>Calangute and Baga</strong>Calangute and Baga (pronounced 'Cull-ung-goot' and 'Bah-Gah') in North Goa are the two most popular beach destinations in Goa. Busy and forever bustling with people, the beaches are dotted with vendors hawking everything from water sports to henna tattoos. The shacks on these two adjacent beaches are very popular and serve lip-smacking food. Simply unwind here and watch the world go by!</p>

								<h3>Fort Aguada and Candolim Beach</h3>
								<p><strong>Fort Aguada and Candolim Beach</strong> are not very crowded and better if you're looking for a romantic stroll or some quiet sunbathing time. They are popular with tourists who choose to live on the more expensive, quieter part of North Goa. Don't miss the historic 4-story lighthouse at the Fort...it's the largest of its kind in Asia!</p>

								<h3>Dona Paula</h3>
								<p><strong>Dona Paula</strong>There is no documented lover's tragedy behind the statue of Dona Paula but the legend is enough to bring scores of visitors to this place every year. Dona Paula is a fun beach, popular for its water sports facilities like windsurfing, parasailing, water-skiing, harpoon fishing, kayaking, snorkeling, and yachting. A colorful water sports festival is hosted on the beach in November every year.</p>

								<h3>Palolem Beach</h3>
								<p><strong>Palolem Beach</strong> is largely virgin and is inhabited by fishermen and tourists who live in shacks along the shore or in the main village itself. It is a mile long, crescent-shaped beach and you can view the whole beach from either end. There are a significant number of rocks here making this more of a sun-tan beach than a sandcastle building experience. The sea shelf is gradual and the currents gentle, making it safe for swimming. Incidentally, this was the beach where the Indian segment of The Bourne Supremacy with Matt Damon was shot.</p>

								<h3>Vasco da Gama</h3>
								<p><strong>Vasco da Gama</strong>Named after the Portuguese explorer who was the first to reach India by water, this city of Goa is perfect for sunsets on beaches. Cansaulim Beach is the best for a nice sunset, while Hollant is the haunt you would target if you are out for a wild night with friends.

								<h3>Mapusa</h3>
								<p><strong>Mapusa</strong>The Mapusa region of Goa is famous for many things, but the topmost among them is the Mapusa Friday Market. As the name suggests, it is held every Friday, and stalls and shops are setup to sell local produce from spices to sweets to cashews and chillies and homemade fish fry and sausages. There are of course beaches to be visited here too — Chapora and Vagator to start with. Churches like St. Jerome Church, Church of Our Lady of Miracles and Cansaulim Church must also be on your list.</p>

The Harvalem Caves were self-excavated in Laterite Hill and include one residential chamber as well. The Pandavas have said to be lived here.

With tourist backpackers and psychedelics crashing here, Anjuna is for those who want to have crazy fun and come with the mantra —What happens in Goa stays in Goa!
